## Load Packages
```{r}

library(MCMCpack)
library(stats)
library(CARBayes) # <- this is the package for the model
library(rgdal) # <- for working with shapefiles
library(RColorBrewer) 
library(ggplot2)
library(rgeos) # <- also for working with shapefiles
library(maptools) # shapefiles again
library(spdep) # still shapefiles 
library(ggmap) # plotting shapefiles 
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(CARBayesST)
library(TSDT)
library(lubridate)

```

## Set-up for Carbays
```{r}
# Number of spatial units (e.g., districts in MDR)
n.district <- 134
n.district2 <- 132

# Create an n x􏰀 n identity matrix
Id.mat <- diag(n.district)
Id.mat2 <- diag(n.district2)

# load shapefile
MDR_2 <- st_read(dsn = '/Users/zoe/Documents/Yale EMD/Rotation 1/Dengue - Vietnam/dengue_exploration/Data/MDR Updated map/VMD_districts_2022.shp')

# remove island districts (no neigbors)
MDR_3 <- MDR_2 %>%
  filter(VARNAME_2 != "Kien Hai", 
         VARNAME_2 != "Phu Quoc")
```

## Neighbor Matrix
```{r}
# Neighbors can either be Queen (any zip that touches another zip - even at 
# corners) or Rook neighbors (share full sides -- not corners)

# The snap dist is governing the NA in neighbor matrix
# Can remove SNAP statement; if Queen = F then single point touch not allowed 
# and Rook distance used.

# Try to make snap distance as small as possible while making sure all districts
# have at least one neighbor
neighb <- poly2nb(MDR_2, queen = T, snap = sqrt(0.001))


# Check average number of links -- increase snap distance if it says there is 
# a zip with zero neighbors
neighb 
  
# Make neighbor matrix 
# if zero.policy FALSE stop with error for any empty neighbour sets, 
# if TRUE permit the weights list to be formed with zero-length weights vectors
# B is the basic binary coding, W is row standardised (both are commonly used)
neighb.mat <- nb2mat(neighb, zero.policy = T, style = 'B')

# the islands will not have neighbors, so need to exclude it at first (islands Kien Hai/District + Phu Quoc/City)
neighb2 <- poly2nb(MDR_3, queen = T, snap = sqrt(0.001))
neighb2
neighb.mat_2 <- nb2mat(neighb2, zero.policy = T, style = 'B')

```

## Save as a .RDS
```{r}

saveRDS(neighb.mat_2, "neighb.mat_2.RDS")

```
