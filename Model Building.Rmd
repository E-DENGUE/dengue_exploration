## Load Packages
```{r}
#library(rjags)
library(MCMCpack)
library(stats)
library(CARBayes) # <- this is the package for the model
library(rgdal) # <- for working with shapefiles
library(RColorBrewer) 
library(ggplot2)
library(rgeos) # <- also for working with shapefiles
library(maptools) # shapefiles again
library(spdep) # still shapefiles 
library(ggmap) # plotting shapefiles 
library(sf)

```


## Set-up for Carbays
```{r}
# Number of spatial units (e.g., districts in MDR)
n.district <- 134

# Create an n x􏰀 n identity matrix
Id.mat <- diag(n.district)

MDR_2 <- st_read(dsn = '/Users/zoe/Documents/Yale EMD/Rotation 1/Dengue - Vietnam/dengue_exploration/Data/MDR Updated map/VMD_districts_2022.shp')

```

## Neighbor Matrix
```{r}
# Neighbors can either be Queen (any zip that touches another zip - even at 
# corners) or Rook neighbors (share full sides -- not corners)

# The snap dist is governing the NA in neighbor matrix
# Can remove SNAP statement; if Queen = F then single point touch not allowed 
# and Rook distance used.

# When data is missing -- there's more non-zero links involved 
# Try to make snap distance as small as possible while making sure all states 
# have at least one neighbor
neighb <- poly2nb(MDR_2, queen = T, snap = sqrt(0.001))

# Check average number of links -- increase snap distance if it says there is 
# a zip with zero neighbors
neighb # Avg Number of links = 5.19403 
  # regions 74 nand 76 have no links, regardless of the snap size??

# Make neighbor matrix 
# if zero.policy FALSE stop with error for any empty neighbour sets, 
# if TRUE permit the weights list to be formed with zero-length weights vectors
# B is the basic binary coding, W is row standardised (both are commonly used)
neighb.mat <- nb2mat(neighb, zero.policy = T, style = 'B')

# For Leroux model, neighbor matrix needs to have 0 if not neighboring, -1 if 
# neighbor, and # of neighbors for each state on diagonal), so...
w.mat <- ifelse(neighb.mat==1,-1,neighb.mat)
num.neigh <- colSums(neighb.mat) # Count the number of neighbors for each state
for (i in 1:nrow(w.mat)) { # Put the number of neighbors on diagonal
  for (j in 1:ncol(w.mat)) {
    if (i==j) {
      w.mat[i,j] <- num.neigh[i]
    }
  }
}
# w.mat <- array(NA, dim=c(n.stzipcode,n.zipcode,n.countries))
# w.mat[,,1] <- ifelse(neighb.mat==1,-1,neighb.mat) # Replace 1 with -1
# num.neigh <- colSums(neighb.mat) # Count the number of neighbors for each state
# for (i in 1:nrow(w.mat[,,1])) { # Put the number of neighbors on diagonal
#   for (j in 1:ncol(w.mat[,,1])) {
#     if (i==j) {
#       w.mat[i,j,1] <- num.neigh[i]
#     }
#   }
# }
